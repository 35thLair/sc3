Jimmie and Sabine,

I've been throwing the Supeme Chi-Town Coding Crew name around for a while now and I'd like to formalize it a bit, in the vein of Open City Apps (http://opencityapps.org) but with a community governance structure inspired by our work at FreeGeek Chicago. And I'd like to invite the two of you to become the first official members. 

Are you coming to Hack Night tomorrow? If so, we can talk about it then. For now, some rambling thoughts which I'll turn into a github repo:

# What is Supreme Chi-Town Coding Crew?

Supreme Chi-Town Coding Crew (SC3) are volunteer developers that educates a diverse group of Chicagoans in practical software development skills and collaboratively develops useful web applications and sites.

# Who is Supreme Chi-Town Coding Crew?

* Sabine Ye
* Jimmie Glover
* David Eads

# Our goals

* We will be as diverse as Chicago. Everyone is welcome, whatever their skill level. 
* We will do outreach among people outside of the mainstream IT industry to recruit those excluded because of racial, gender, and generational bias.
* We will release our software under the GNU General Public license version 3.
* We will build web applications that investigate our city.
* We will build open APIs if our software uses and processes data.
* We will be governed by consensus. 

# Governance

* Big decisions such as projects we'll tackle will be made by formal consensus by everyone with administrative privileges on the SC3 Github account (https://github.com/sc3).
* For the moment, anyone with commit privileges can give anyone else commit privileges.
* Anyone may submit a proposal to be considered using consensus on the Github issue tracker.

# Formal consensus

Consensus means that for a formal decision, decision-makers may:

* Agree: You'd like to get on board.
* Step aside: You have reservations or simply no resources to contribute to the decision, but you don't oppose it.
* Veto: You get one veto for life. If you veto a proposal, it will not be considered again. 

# Evolving model

Like FreeGeek Chicago early on, we'll use the consensus process to refine and improve this document.

# Projects

* Hopper VM
* Townsquare
* Chicago Birthrates
* Cook County Inmate Tracker (proposed)
