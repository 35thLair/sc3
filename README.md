# What is Supreme Chi-Town Coding Crew?

Supreme Chi-Town Coding Crew (SC3) are volunteer developers that educates a diverse group of Chicagoans in practical software development skills and collaboratively develops useful web applications and sites.

# Our goals

* We will be as diverse as Chicago. Everyone is welcome, whatever their skill level. 
* We will do outreach among people outside of the mainstream IT industry to recruit those excluded because of racial, gender, and generational bias.
* We will release our software under free software licenses, primarily the GNU GPL version 3.
* We will build web applications that investigate our city.
* We will build open APIs when our software uses and processes data.
* We will be governed by consensus by a group of 3 - 10 project maintainers.
* We will have a blast.

# Governance

* Big decisions such as what projects we'll tackle and licenses we'll use will be made by formal consensus (see below) by everyone with administrative privileges on the SC3 Github account (https://github.com/sc3).
* For the moment, anyone with administrative privileges can give anyone else administrative privileges.
* Anyone may submit a proposal to be considered using consensus on the Github issue tracker.

# Formal consensus

Consensus means that for a formal decision, decision-makers may:

* Agree: You'd like to get on board.
* Step aside: You have reservations or simply no resources to contribute to the decision, but you don't oppose it.
* Veto: You get one veto for life. If you veto a proposal, it will not be considered again. 

# Evolving model

Like FreeGeek Chicago early on, we'll use the consensus process to refine and improve this document.
